# Movie_Website
A Udacity program

22/01/2018 01:15

After 3 days studied in Udacity, I finished my first movie website with python2.

There are three files in this program:

fresh_tomatoes.py is a starter code repository that contains a Python module.
media.py is to define the class.
Movie_Website.py is a file to append or edit movie list, and to run the program.

The code is error free and follows PEP-8 Guidelines.(Except some inevitable url lenth)
