# Movie_Website
A Udacity program

22/01/2018 01:15

After 3 days studied in Udacity, I finished my first movie website with python2.

There are three files in this program:

fresh_tomatoes.py is a starter code repository that contains a Python module.
media.py is to define the class.
Movie_Website.py is a file to append or edit movie list, and to run the program.

To use this project, you must have Python installed.

1.Download the codes or clone the repository   
2.Open cmd and change directory to the folder   
3.Enter "python Movie_Website.py" to run the project   
4.Enjoy the website   

The code is error free and follows PEP-8 Guidelines.(Except some inevitable url lenth)
